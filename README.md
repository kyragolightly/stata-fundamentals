# D-Lab Stata Fundamentals: Parts 1-3

This is the repository for D-Lab's introductory Stata-Fundamentals workshop series. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Workshop Goals

This three-part series will cover the following materials:

### Part 1:  Introduction
* Loading datasets into Stata (no previous knowledge expected)
* * Examining a dataset and finding variables of interest
* Summarizing and tabulating variables
* Stata specific tools and resources (do files, logs, help files, etc.)
* Coding and cleaning data (making new variables from old variables; labeling variables and values, etc.)
* Using logical operators in Stata
* Cross-tabulations

### Part 2: Data Analysis in Stata 
* Correlation
* T-tests
* Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and logistic regression (basic syntax, using interaction terms, interpreting output)
* Visualization (histograms, bar graphs, scatter plots)
* Regression postestimation (getting predicted values, basic graphs)
* Merging and appending datasets

### Part 3: Stata Programming
* Local and global variables (macros)
* Looping (foreach, forvalues)
* Reshaping data between wide and long formats
* Recalling and using command output
* Generating nicely formatted journal-style tables

# Is Stata not working on your laptop?

Attend the workshop anyway, we can provide you with a cloud-based solution (DataHub or Binder) until you figure out the problems with your local installation. 

If you have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can run these lessons on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2Fpython-fundamentals&urlpath=tree%2Fpython-fundamentals%2F). By using this link, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the Stata-Fundamentals folder.
If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this [Binder button](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals/master). By using this button, you cannot save your work.
